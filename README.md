## Hi there, I'm Creed
Incoming Software Engineer @ Sentry Insurance. My academic and research interests are deeply rooted in the practical application of computing and digital electronics to address and solve real-world challenges.

My expertise extends to the development and implementation of embedded systems and robotic control systems, showcasing my passion for integrating hardware with software to create comprehensive solutions. For a glimpse into my work within this domain, I invite you to explore my repository dedicated to my latest robotic endeavor, the ROS Differential Drive Autonomous Mobile Robot, available at [ROS AMR]([https://github.com/czagrzebski/ROS-AGV](https://github.com/czagrzebski/ROS-AMR)).

Additionally, I possess a strong passion for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) across various platforms, including AutoCAD, Inventor, KiCAD, and Solidworks, complemented by an interest in 3D printing technologies. These skills enable me to bring ideas from conception to reality, merging design with practical functionality.
