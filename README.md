## Hi there, I'm Creed
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin -- La Crosse. My academic and research interests are deeply rooted in the practical application of computing and digital electronics to address and solve real-world challenges.

My expertise extends to the development and implementation of embedded systems and robotic control systems, showcasing my passion for integrating hardware with software to create comprehensive solutions. For a glimpse into my work within this domain, I invite you to explore my repository dedicated to my latest robotic endeavor, the ROS AGV, available at [ROS AGV](https://github.com/czagrzebski/ROS-AGV).

Additionally, I possess a strong affinity for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) across various platforms, including AutoCAD, Inventor, and Solidworks, complemented by a keen interest in 3D printing technologies. These skills enable me to bring ideas from conception to reality, merging design with practical functionality.
